# Flappy Bird 
Project Description

The project is based upon GLUT i.e. the OpenGL Utility Toolkit, a window system
independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs. OpenGL is a cross-language, cross-
platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.

It is similar to the famous Flappy Bird game made using OpenGL in C++. It uses the OpenGL
library GLUT and its various functions and functionalities along with C++ to give an
experience similar to the famous android game Flappy Bird. It is developed in visual studio
2019.

This project explores the use of physical law (gravitational law) for the game development.
The game in its exactness follows rules similar to that of the original game known as flappy
bird. The rules and regulation of the game are very basic and easy to understand. The game
scenario puts the player in control of a hovering bird with its wings flying in the screen with
moving obstacles of pipelines. The goal of the game is to get through the opening in the
obstacles without colliding into them. The game is implemented in C++. Also we have tries
implementing various graphics to make our game more attractive like buildings in the
background in addition with clouds and grass and flowers on ground and the morning to night
view while the player continue to play. The case study discusses the use of simpler motion and
modification to build the abstraction. The game is in single player mode. The user can interact
with the game using keyboard.
